TODO: Missing States: Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New_Jersey, New_York, Rhode_Island, Virginia. Check if specify state name, will the information retrieved by SPARQL (using SPAQRL 3.).
TODO: Missing counties. 
     1) add the county type and state type in county_state file.
	 2) check the city_county triples from DBpedia, see if any info missing.
	 3) check the city_zipcode triples from DBpedia, see if any zipcode infor missing.
	 4) consider to get more authentic city zip code data if there is any.




Changed the city_county_transfer.py, because the DBpedia SPARQL reveal the relation of cities only. Previous mistake is assert county_state statement. Changed to city_state statement. Added county_state statement extracted from DBpedia.
